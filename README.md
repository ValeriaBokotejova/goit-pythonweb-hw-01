This repository contains two Python tasks that demonstrate object-oriented design principles and clean architecture.

## Task 1: Factory Pattern

Implements the Factory Design Pattern to create different types of vehicles (`Car`, `Motorcycle`) with region-specific specifications (e.g., "US Spec", "EU Spec"). The solution uses abstract base classes and logging instead of `print`.

**Key concepts:**
- Factory pattern
- Inheritance and abstraction
- Logging and type hints

## Task 2: SOLID Principles

Refactors a basic command-line library app to follow all five SOLID principles using interfaces, abstraction, and separation of responsibilities. Logging is used to display messages.

**Key concepts:**
- SOLID principles
- Dependency inversion via interface injection
- Clean command-line interaction

---

All code is fully typed, uses logging at INFO level, and is formatted using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/).
